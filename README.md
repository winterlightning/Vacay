Vacay
========

Small teams needs a single purpose tool to formally manage sick and vacation days. Vacay is that tool.
Most HR software does too much and are used in large companies, for smaller businesses there doesn't exist a universally recognized brand for efficient management of sick days and vacation days. This is literally the only HR function most small companies/startups need. A single use software just makes a lot of sense.

Goals

Solve the problem of tracking vacation days of the past and future.
